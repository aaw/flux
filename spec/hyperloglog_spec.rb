  # With parameter b, HyperLogLog should produce estimates that have
  # relative error of 1.04 / Math.sqrt(2 ** b). Of course, this analysis
  # is based on assumptions that aren't necessarily true in practice and
  # the observed relative error will depend on the distribution of data
  # we receive as well as the interaction of the murmur hash implementation
  # with that data. Keeping that in mind, the following spec makes sure 
  # that in the process of adding 1000 values to a set, HyperLogLog only 
  # gives bad estimates (more than twice the expected relative error) in 
  # less than 1% of the cases and never gives very bad estimates (more than
  # three times the expected relative error.)
  #
  # It's fine to fudge these numbers a little if the implementation changes,
  # since you can clearly find a different set of values that make this test 
  # fail even without changing the implementation. But it should serve as a 
  # good indication that there aren't any logical errors in the HyperLogLog
  # implementation, since it exercises all of the cases in HyperLogLog's
  # count method except for the correction for very large set sizes.
